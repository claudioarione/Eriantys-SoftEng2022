### Extra functionalities
- **Random nickname generator**: allows the user to participate in a match with a random-chosen username. This is possible either clicking on the apposite button
in GUI or leaving blank the *username* field when asked
- **Internationalization**: it's possible to play Eriantys in different languages - currently Italian and English - according to the choice of the user.
Game language can be chosen from the apposite popup in the login screen (for GUI) or setting a language tag (two letters) in the *game_language* field in `deliveries/Jar/settings.json` file

## Instructions for use
To use the application launch the JAR file from a terminal (Linux, MacOS) or Powershell (Windows).
NOTE: We cannot ensure an optimal CLI game experience on Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)  
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar [SERVER | GUI | CLI] [PORT] [ADDRESS]
```
All arguments are optional. 
- If the `[SERVER | GUI | CLI]` is omitted than GUI is launched
- If both the `PORT` and `ADDRESS` parameters are omitted then those values are taken from the configuration file in `deliveries/Jar/settings.json`
### Server
To launch the server using the port found in `deliveries/Jar/settings.json`
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar server
```
Alternatively the port can be provided by argument. For example, to launch a server
listening on port 7373:
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar server 7373
```

### Client (CLI)
To launch the cli using the server port and server address found in `deliveries/Jar/settings.json`
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar cli
```
Alternatively port and address can be provided by argument. For example, to launch a CLI client
searching for a server at 192.168.1.10:7373 (note: local address, to play from different LANs port forwarding is required)
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar cli 7373 192.168.1.10
```

### Client (GUI)
To launch the gui using the server port and server address found in `deliveries/Jar/settings.json`
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar gui
```

Alternatively port and address can be provided by argument. For example, to launch a CLI client
searching for a server at 192.168.1.10:7373 (note: local address, to play from different LANs port forwarding is required)
Note: if port and address are provided as arguments (without using the settings.json file) the gui argument cannot be omitted
```
java -jar ./deliveries/Jar/Eriantys.jar cli 7373 192.168.1.10
```
